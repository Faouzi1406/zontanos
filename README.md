# zontanos

This contains both the cli and the compiler of zontanos.
The cli can be used to compile zontanos source code. 

This language is more of a learning project, and that is why I wrote it. However I hope to one day make a good language of this, that could actually be used by many people.

# Example 

- Example of factorial function implemented in zontanos: https://github.com/Faouzi1406/zontanos/blob/master/zonc_cli/main.zon#L1
